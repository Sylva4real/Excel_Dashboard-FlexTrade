# Excel_Dashboard-FlexTrade
This project features Excel dashboards and PowerPoint presentations I developed for FlexTrade, an e-commerce platform. Through data analysis and visualisation, I identified key business insights to optimise customer engagement, streamline the checkout process, and drive sales growth.

An online shopping brand faced high bounce rates, cart abandonment, and low average order value, limiting sales and customer engagement. Despite having a user-friendly app, many visitors exited without making purchases.
I conducted an Excel dashboard analysis to identify performance gaps, analyse user behaviour trends, and provide actionable recommendations to enhance the shopping experience and increase conversions.

Key Actions Taken:

✔ Data Cleaning & Preparation – Ensured accuracy and consistency for meaningful insights.

✔ KPI Identification – Focused on bounce rate, cart abandonment rate, conversion rates, and average order value.

✔ Data Visualization – Created an interactive Excel dashboard using pivot tables, slicers, and dynamic charts for trend analysis.

✔ Trend & Pattern Analysis – Applied conditional formatting and calculated fields to highlight performance bottlenecks and customer behaviours.

✔ Actionable Insights & Recommendations – Developed a PowerPoint report presenting data-driven strategies to optimise UX, streamline checkout, and increase conversions.
This data-driven approach provided key business insights, enabling strategic improvements that enhanced user engagement, improved checkout efficiency, and boosted overall sales.
